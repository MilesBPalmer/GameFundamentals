This game is a collection of everything that i am learning within unity, each level is going to contain new features that i have learned within unity.
level 1 is a basic start to the game, it contains movement and a basic square to player character and box for the ground.
A Main Menu will be created inbetween level 1 and 2 to ensure that i can test if the play button works by accessing level 1.
level 2 will contain new assets that include Character and Ground textures that i will create using Aseprite and maybe animations included in this level too.
